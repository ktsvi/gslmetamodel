# gslmetamodel
This code represents an experimentation of a research work related to the Spatially explicit agent-based modelling. A metamodel called GSL is propose to generate a base code of SE agent model for sinumation. GSL is used to easily and quickly produce a spatially explicit agent-based model from specifications provided jointly by domain experts and system analysts. Then, a generator engine called ABMGenerator is produced as a support for modelling with GAMA platform.
